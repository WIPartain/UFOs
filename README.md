# UFOs
## Overview

We used JavaScript, Bootstrap, and HTML to create a webpage and dynamic table which allows the user to filter through data using multiple criteria at the same time.  We created filters for date, city, state, county, and shape to consolidate UFO sighting information.

## Analysis

Once entering the website, clients will be greeted by the title and a synopsis for the purpose of the website.

Further down the website, clients will be able to view the ufo sighting data, and the 5 filters we will use to sort through said data.

By entering the desired search criteria in the fields to the left of the data, clients should be able to sort by date, city, state, county, and shape.

In between searches, clients can clear the filters by clicking the clear filter button.  Multiple filters can be utlitized at the same time in order to narrow the client's search more effectively.

## Summary

This webpage is organized and effective, however there are a few drawbacks to this style of webpage.  First, the information is static, and will not be updated as the information changes over the years.  If we had added a scraper to a different site that pulls new ufo sighting data, our webpage would be more effective.  Second, our filters are limited by requiring an exact match to the data in the chart.  If we could implement dropdown fields instead of open ended searches, the website's search functions would be more user friendly.
